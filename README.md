## Event details
HacktoberfestÂ® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Rules
To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

## What is you do? (How to Create Pull pull Requests)

## Let's work together to reduce spam
- Spammy pull requests can be given a label that contains the word "invalid" or "spam" to discount them. Maintainers are faced with the majority of spam that occurs during Hacktoberfest, and we dislike spam just as much as you. If you're a maintainer, please label any spammy pull requests submitted to the repositories you maintain as "invalid" or "spam", and close them. Pull requests with this label won't count toward Hacktoberfest.

- There's a seven-day review window for all pull requests before they count toward completing the challenge. Once a participant has submitted four eligible pull requests (ready-to-review, not drafts), the review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label spammy pull requests as invalid. If the pull requests are not marked as invalid within that window, they will allow the user to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If any of the pull requests are labeled as invalid, the user will return to the pending state until they have four eligible pull requests, at which point the review period will start again.

- Bad repositories will be excluded. In the past, we've seen many repositories that encourage participants to make simple pull requests â€“ such as adding their name to a file â€“ to quickly gain a pull request toward completing Hacktoberfest. While this may be a learning tool for new contributors, it goes against one of our core values for Hacktoberfest. The quality of pull requests is paramount; quantity comes second. These repositories do not encourage quality contributions and provide an unfair advantage in completing the Hacktoberfest challenge. We've implemented a system to block these repositories, and any pull requests submitted to such repositories will not be counted.
