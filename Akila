A recent survey found that although cash bonuses can improve physician executive job
performance, money is not too helpful when it comes to improving job satisfaction.
According to the survey of physician executives, personal growth, personal development,
life/work balance, effective communications and personal relationships are the true keys to
improving satisfaction. The informal survey questioned 104 physician leaders and included
CEOs, vice presidents of medical affairs, medical directors, department chairs, and consultants.
It examined both individual and organizational views of job satisfaction. When asked to
describe successful methods of improving job satisfaction for their staff:
• 46 percent of respondents described improving communications and personal
relationships.
• 9 percent mentioned improving leadership quality.
• Only 3 percent of respondents stated that bonuses successfully could be used to improve
satisfaction at the staff level.
When it comes to dealing with staff, one respondent said, “listen to them and treat them with
respect”. Another respondent said, “Give them credit for their help and ideas whenever there
is an opportunity, especially in front of my bosses or in a larger group. Ask them what they
need to do their job better and then try to give it to them. If we can’t give it to them, be honest
and ask for other suggestions”. Another participant said more money is certainly not the
answer. Added pay for added responsibility does not work if they really did not want the
responsibility in the first place”.
Using the Herzberg's Two Factor Theory, explain the informal survey’s results regarding
employees’ motivation needs.
